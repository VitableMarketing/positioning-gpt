**Meeting Summary for Classic Home Health Clearwater and Vitable Health**

**Participants:**
- Ryan Plank (Vitable Health)
- Olivia Berens (Vitable Health)
- Lori Tipton (Classic Home Health Clearwater)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Introduction and Current Challenges**
   - The meeting began with an overview from Lori, explaining that Classic Home Health has recently transitioned from Blue Cross to Paychex for employee benefits.
   - Lori noted that the organization is currently focused on updating policies and procedures and facing staffing changes. As a result, changing health benefits isn’t a top priority right now.
   - Despite this, Lori expressed an interest in understanding Vitable Health’s offerings, particularly to forward any potentially useful information to the HR and operations teams for consideration.

2. **Vitable's Plan Offerings and Target Clients**
   - Ryan provided details on Vitable Health’s focus on providing affordable healthcare options, especially for companies just reaching the **50 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)** threshold, where ACA compliance becomes mandatory.
   - He highlighted Vitable’s offerings, including:
     - **Primary Care Plan** for $30 per employee per month, which includes telehealth services, free prescriptions, no copays or deductibles, and coverage for dependents.
     - **MEC and MEC Plus Plans**, which offer broader coverage including urgent care, specialist visits, and imaging, with costs ranging from $30 to $125 per month depending on the plan.
   - Ryan made it clear that while Vitable plans focus on primary care and wellness, they do not typically cover hospitalizations or critical illnesses, which makes them different from traditional major medical plans like those offered by Blue Cross.

3. **Potential Use Cases for Vitable at Classic Home Health**
   - Ryan suggested that Vitable’s healthcare offerings could be a good secondary option for those employees who cannot afford the current major medical plan. This could be especially useful for part-time or PRN (as-needed) staff who are often excluded from full-time health benefits.
   - Lori expressed interest in the idea of offering a lower-cost, company-funded benefit to PRN staff, which could help attract and retain employees. She mentioned the potential to tie coverage availability to the number of hours worked by PRN staff.
   - Lori also noted that the cost of existing benefits, even after the employer contribution, is still significant for employees, making an affordable alternative like Vitable appealing for some staff.

4. **TB Testing Options**
   - Ryan brought up Vitable’s TB testing platform, which uses a one-step blood draw method through partnerships with Labcorp and Quest, aimed at streamlining onboarding.
   - Lori described the current TB testing process at Classic Home Health, where employees need to obtain their own TB tests, often leading to inefficiencies and extra costs, especially given the requirement to dispose of testing vials within 30 days.
   - Lori showed some interest in the TB testing platform, particularly if it could streamline operations for HR, but emphasized that any discussions about switching or implementing new procedures would need to involve Genesis, their HR lead.

5. **Next Steps and Considerations**
   - Ryan agreed to send Lori further information, including a formulary of covered prescriptions and a list of network providers. Lori indicated she would forward this information to their HR lead for review.
   - Lori also mentioned that a review of health benefits would likely be revisited closer to their renewal period in June 2025, and suggested reaching out again in **March** for more focused discussions.

**Company Information:**

1. **Company Name:** Classic Home Health Clearwater
2. **Company Industry:** Home Healthcare Services
3. **Company Size:** Approximately 50-100 full-time staff, plus a significant number of PRN and contract workers
4. **Previous Knowledge of TB Testing:** Familiar with in-house TB testing but currently outsourcing due to logistical inefficiencies.
5. **Core Challenges:**
   - Current high cost of health benefits, making it unaffordable for many employees, particularly PRN staff.
   - Staffing and operational challenges, with policy updates and staffing changes creating a busy environment.
6. **What They're Looking For:**
   - Affordable, alternative healthcare options that could complement or provide a secondary option to major medical plans.
   - Streamlined onboarding processes, particularly for required TB testing.

**Next Steps Suggested:**
- Ryan to send additional information, including the formulary and network provider list.
- Lori to share the information internally, especially with Genesis, the HR lead, for further evaluation.
- Ryan to follow up in **March** 2025 to align with Classic Home Health’s renewal timeline and reassess potential partnership opportunities.
