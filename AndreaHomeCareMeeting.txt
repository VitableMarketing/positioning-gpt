**Meeting Summary for Andrea Homecare Group and Vitable Health**

**Participants:**
- Shawn Parsons (Vitable Health)
- Brian Cottone Jr. (Vitable Health)
- Katherine Solano (Andrea Homecare Group)
- Elena Pistorius (Andrea Homecare Group)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Recap of Previous Conversations and Key Priorities**
   - The meeting began with a recap of the previous discussions, with Katherine highlighting that Andrea Homecare has 120 employees, split between 60 full-time and 60 part-time staff.
   - Currently, Andrea Homecare Group does not offer medical benefits to employees, which has prompted the exploration of potential partnerships with Vitable Health.
   - Katherine mentioned that the primary focus for their employee benefits includes **quality healthcare**, **affordability**, and **ease of access to providers**, rather than the brand name of the insurance carrier.

2. **Vitable Health Plan Offerings**
   - Shawn and Brian presented several options including the **Primary Care Plan**, the **MVP Plan**, and **Vitable Minimum Value Plans** (MVP) that include hospitalization.
   - The Primary Care Plan is available at $30 per month, offering no-cost services for virtual and in-home primary care visits, prescription management, mental health services, and wellness visits for employees and their dependents.
   - Katherine raised concerns about offering plans that include hospitalization and urgent care coverage, which led to a discussion about three MVP options:
     - **MVP 6500 Plan**: $595 per month with a $6,500 deductible.
     - **MVP 1500 Plan**: $444 per month with a $1,500 deductible.
     - **MVP Zero Deductible Plan**: $634 per month, requiring a minimum of five enrollees.

3. **Challenges and Concerns About Employee Enrollment**
   - Elena expressed frustration with past difficulties in trying to explain the Vitable benefits to her employees, particularly the lower-cost plans, as many employees considered them to be less comprehensive.
   - There was extensive discussion about the affordability of these plans for caregivers, as most of the employees fall into a lower wage bracket.
   - Brian noted that the previous minimum for the MVP plans was 50 employees, but this has now been reduced to 35 employees, which might make the rollout more feasible for Andrea Homecare. 
   - Katherine also highlighted the difficulty in ensuring enough employees are willing to pay for coverage, even at a subsidized rate. She emphasized the skepticism employees have towards plans that do not include hospitalizations or emergency care.

4. **Compliance with ACA Requirements**
   - Katherine asked about ACA compliance, specifically how the MVP plans would fulfill ACA mandates for affordability and minimum value.
   - Brian clarified that for compliance with the ACA, the maximum contribution rate for employees cannot exceed **9.02%** of their income, ensuring affordability. He also explained that compliance requirements would become mandatory when Andrea Homecare reached **50 full-time equivalents (FTEs)**.

5. **Next Steps and Enrollment Plans**
   - Shawn and Brian proposed offering the Vitable Primary Care Plan to both full-time and part-time employees, along with one of the MVP options for office staff.
   - Elena mentioned that they currently have **35 full-time staff**, but many office staff are part-time, making it challenging to reach the enrollment minimum.
   - Katherine expressed a willingness to subsidize 50% of the Vitable Primary Care Plan, which could make the plans more attractive to employees.
   - The final decision on enrolling in the plans would depend on gauging interest from office staff and part-time employees.
   - Shawn committed to providing detailed information regarding network access, as well as a summary of the benefits, so that the Andrea Homecare team could properly explain them to employees.
