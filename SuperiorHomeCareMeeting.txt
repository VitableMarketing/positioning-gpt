   - The **Primary Care Plan** has zero costs for employees, making it an appealing option for those who cannot afford traditional health insurance.

4. **Employee Engagement and Challenges**
   - Kim mentioned that employees often do not engage with benefits even when they are offered for free, due to perceived complexities and distrust of healthcare systems.
