### Summary of Meeting between Hygeia Visiting Angels and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Lauren Brady (Vitable Health)
- Connie Nelson, COO/CCO (Hygeia Visiting Angels)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Current TB Testing Process:**
   - Connie Nelson shared that Hygeia Visiting Angels currently uses the traditional two-step PPD process for TB testing, which requires employees to visit twice, making it inconvenient and resulting in delays during the hiring process.
   - The cost for the two-step test is $35 per step, and Hygeia covers this cost for employees.
   - Connie noted that a significant number of employees do not complete the second step, which causes issues during the onboarding process.

2. **Interest in Vitable’s TB Testing Solution:**
   - Lauren presented Vitable's one-step Quantiferon Gold TB test as a streamlined alternative that would reduce the number of required visits and simplify the testing process for new hires.
   - Vitable’s solution includes partnerships with Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics, offering multiple locations for testing to make it more convenient for employees.
   - The process was explained as fully digital, with instant lab order creation through Vitable’s platform, allowing tracking of each step, including scheduling and receiving results directly.

3. **Pricing and Options for TB Testing:**
   - Lauren detailed Vitable’s quarterly testing package, which allows flexibility in the number of tests performed per month.
   - The cost for Labcorp tests was quoted at $55 per test, while Quest tests would cost $70 each.
   - Lauren highlighted the benefits of choosing Labcorp as the primary provider due to the lower cost, while also recommending that Hygeia purchase a few Quest tests to ensure flexibility for employees based on location convenience.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Connie expressed interest in transitioning to the one-step test to improve efficiency but needs to pull more data before committing.
   - Connie and Lauren agreed on a follow-up call for the upcoming Friday to discuss further details after Connie reviews the pricing and map locations for the labs.
   - Lauren will send Connie additional information via email, including the location links for Quest and Labcorp testing centers, and a detailed breakdown of the pricing and available options.
