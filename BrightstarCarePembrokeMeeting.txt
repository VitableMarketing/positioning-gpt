**Meeting Summary for BrightStar Care Pembroke Pines & Weston and Vitable Health**

**Participants:**
- Ryan Plank (Vitable Health)
- Richard Lovelace (BrightStar Care)
- Olivia Berens (BrightStar Care)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Introduction and Context**
   - Richard shared that BrightStar Care is evaluating different healthcare options for employees as they consider reaching the status of a large employer by 2024, based on Affordable Care Act (ACA) criteria.
   - The company currently uses Blue Cross Blue Shield for employee health insurance. However, they are facing challenges related to high costs, and are exploring alternatives that are more cost-effective.
   - Richard expressed an interest in understanding Vitable's offerings and how they compare with other plans available, especially in terms of affordability for part-time and full-time employees.

2. **Vitable's Plan Overview**
   - Ryan introduced Vitable's two main offerings: the **Part A Compliant Plan** and the **Part B Compliant Plan**, explaining that these would help ensure compliance with ACA regulations.
   - The **Primary Care Plan** is company-funded and comes in two cost options: **$30 per employee per month** or **$40 per employee per month**. This plan includes zero-dollar copays, zero-dollar deductibles for primary care services, wellness checks, mental health support, and access to over 1,000 prescription medications.
   - For more comprehensive coverage, Vitable also provides an **MVP Plan**, which covers hospitalizations and emergency services.

3. **Compliance with Affordable Care Act Requirements**
   - Ryan explained the ACA requirements for employers, particularly concerning **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)** calculations. BrightStar Care, with its numerous part-time caregivers, might reach 50 FTEs by 2024, triggering ACA compliance obligations.
   - Richard was keen to understand how penalties work under ACA if they failed to provide compliant healthcare coverage. Ryan clarified the distinctions between **Part A** and **Part B** of ACA: 
     - **Part A Penalty**: If an employer fails to offer a Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) plan, they may face penalties based on the number of full-time employees, minus the first 30.
     - **Part B Penalty**: If employees receive marketplace coverage with a premium tax credit, the employer could be fined on a per-employee basis.
   - Ryan showed Richard a calculator to help estimate potential penalties and demonstrated that offering Vitable's **Primary Care Plan** could protect them against Part A penalties.

4. **Comparison with Existing Insurance Plans**
   - Richard mentioned the quotes he previously received from Florida Blue, which were significantly more expensive, ranging between **$300 and $700 per month per employee**.
   - He emphasized the need to offer affordable coverage, particularly for part-time staff who are often paid lower wages.
   - Ryan outlined that the **MVP Plan** could provide coverage similar to that of major insurers like Florida Blue but at a more affordable rate. The MVP plan with hospitalization included costs around **$595 per month**, though it could vary based on the insurer and broker.

5. **Coverage and Network Considerations**
   - Richard asked about the network coverage in specific locations like **Broward County**. Ryan highlighted that Vitable uses **HealthSmart**, a national PPO network, ensuring comprehensive coverage with a substantial number of primary care providers in Florida.
   - They discussed the need for the network to adequately cover areas like Broward County, where most BrightStar Care employees are located.

6. **Next Steps and Considerations**
   - Richard shared that he would have a call with another insurance broker soon, and this would help determine how Vitable compares with the competition.
   - Ryan suggested a follow-up discussion after Richard's call to delve deeper into the specifics of Vitable's plans, especially around the employee enrollment process and the logistics of setting up the healthcare benefits.
