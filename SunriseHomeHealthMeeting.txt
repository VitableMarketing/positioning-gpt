**Participants:**
- Ryan Eiker (Vitable Health)
- Dr. Peter (Sunrise Group Home and Soar Group Home)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Meeting Objective**
   - The main focus of this meeting was to recap the previous conversation and finalize the discussion on the suitability of Vitable's health plans for Dr. Peter's group homes, Sunrise and Soar.
   - Ryan highlighted the key areas discussed previously, including the importance of Affordable Care Act (ACA) compliance, plan options, pricing, and the next steps if both parties agreed to move forward.

2. **Healthcare Requirements and ACA Compliance**
   - Dr. Peter operates two group homes, Sunrise and Soar, both of which need to stay ACA compliant as they employ around **50 full-time employees**, which meets the threshold for mandatory healthcare offerings.
   - Ryan explained the ACA requirements, specifically **Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC)** and **Minimum Value Plans**, emphasizing the need to comply to avoid penalties.
   - Dr. Peter's main concern was providing healthcare benefits that included basic care, emergency services, and medication access. He indicated that cost was a critical factor, while the brand name of the plan was less important.

3. **Overview of Vitable Health's Offerings**
   - Ryan presented three healthcare options:
     - **Vitable Primary Care Plan**: Designed for telehealth, mental health services, and virtual appointments, available at **$30 per employee per month**. Employees have access to same-day doctor visits, prescriptions, and lab tests.
     - **MEC Plan**: Offers additional wellness services like in-person preventive screenings. Employees can opt into this plan at **$30 per month**.
     - **MEC Plus Plan**: Includes specialist visits, urgent care, and other comprehensive offerings at **$125 per month**.
   - Ryan clarified that the **Vitable Primary Care Plan** would be employer-funded, while the **MEC and MEC Plus** plans would be optional upgrades paid by the employees.

4. **Cost and Compliance Considerations**
   - Ryan emphasized the importance of **ACA compliance** to avoid substantial fines. He explained that offering a MEC plan was crucial for compliance, and failure to do so could result in penalties up to **$3,000 per non-compliant employee**.
   - For Dr. Peter's group homes, the minimum spend to cover 50 employees would be **$1,500 per month**, which includes the Vitable Primary Care Plan. There would also be a **one-time setup fee of $1,500**.
   - Ryan provided a breakdown of the penalties that could be incurred if the group home failed to offer required coverage, using an **ACA penalty calculator** to illustrate potential fines.

5. **Healthcare Goals for Employees**
   - Dr. Peter's goal was to ensure his employees could access basic healthcare without financial burden. He emphasized the importance of day-to-day health maintenance, as well as the ability to see a doctor for emergencies.
   - While Dr. Peter acknowledged the value of having surgery covered, Ryan explained that surgeries are not included in the primary care plans. However, **accidental and critical illness coverage** could be arranged through partners for employees who opt-in.

6. **Next Steps and Decision Timeline**
   - Dr. Peter showed interest in moving forward with the **Vitable Primary Care Plan**, with the possibility of allowing employees to upgrade to MEC or MEC Plus if desired.
   - Dr. Peter requested additional time to discuss the proposal with his directors and agreed to receive the agreement details via email.
