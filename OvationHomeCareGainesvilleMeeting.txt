**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Introduction and Background**
   - The meeting was held to revisit Vitable Health's offerings and discuss Ovation Home Care’s potential interest in partnering with Vitable for healthcare benefits.
   - Marylin shared that Ovation Home Care is in the process of evaluating healthcare options while also focusing on internal metrics and stability, specifically related to payroll hours and overall employee engagement.
   - Ryan mentioned that Vitable’s healthcare solutions could help Ovation provide benefits that attract and retain employees without requiring a specific number of hours worked.

2. **Current Challenges for Ovation Home Care**
   - **Employee Coverage Requirements**: Marylin explained that Ovation Home Care is working to meet specific payroll hour targets before committing to additional health benefits. Many employees work **PRN (as-needed)** shifts, and they are cautious about adding additional costs until numbers stabilize.
   - **Current Insurance Issues**: Marylin mentioned that several caregivers are on **state benefits** and prefer not to take on extra hours that might jeopardize their current benefits.
   - **Cost of Existing Coverage**: Marylin also shared that she personally pays a lot for insurance, and Ovation is looking for an option that’s financially accessible for both the company and its employees.

3. **Overview of Vitable’s Plan Options**
   - **Primary Care Plan**:
     - The **Primary Care Plan** offers telehealth services, no-cost same-day virtual appointments, and mental health services, all accessible through the Vitable app.
     - It costs **$30 per employee per month**, with the company funding this benefit for eligible employees.
   - **MEC and MEC Plus Plans**:
     - The **MEC Plan** and **MEC Plus Plan** are buy-up options that allow employees to access more services, such as urgent care, specialist visits, and in-person care.
     - The **MEC Plus Plan** also includes hospitalization and emergency services at **$444 per employee per month**.
   - **Coverage Flexibility**: Ryan emphasized that the **primary care portion** is company-funded, while the MEC and MEC Plus are employee contributions deducted from payroll if they choose to opt-in.

4. **Cancellation and Plan Adjustments**
   - Marylin inquired about **cancellation policies** and whether there are penalties for discontinuing Vitable’s services if they are no longer a good fit.
   - Ryan clarified that Vitable does not enforce heavy penalties for cancellation, explaining that if Ovation Home Care decided to cancel the partnership, they could do so without facing legal challenges or heavy exit costs.
   - Ryan also assured Marylin that Vitable is committed to offering flexible and practical solutions to ensure their partners are fully satisfied with the service.

5. **Key Concerns and Discussion**
   - **Cost Considerations**: Marylin appreciated the pricing but mentioned that the implementation timeline would depend on reaching a stable number of working hours for their PRN staff.
   - **Staff Utilization**: There was a discussion about whether Ovation Home Care would want to offer coverage to **PRN staff**. Marylin indicated that initially, they may only offer benefits to full-time staff.
   - **Employee Survey**: Marylin mentioned that before making any decisions, she wants to survey employees to gauge interest and better understand which plan options may be the most valuable.

6. **Next Steps**
   - Ryan proposed following up in **two to three months** when Ovation Home Care is ready to make a decision.
   - Marylin indicated that early **next year** would be the ideal time to finalize decisions, provided they meet their baseline targets for employee work hours.
   - Ryan also mentioned the **seven-week onboarding** process, with new cohorts starting on the first of each month, which gives Marylin a clear understanding of the timelines for onboarding.
