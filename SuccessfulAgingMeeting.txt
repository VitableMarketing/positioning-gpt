**Meeting Summary between Successful Aging Care Net and Vitable Health**

**Participants:**
- Jeremy Lopez (Vitable Health)
- Peta Gay Myrie (Successful Aging Care Net)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Background and Current Partnership with Vitable Health**
   - Successful Aging Care Net already has an existing account with Vitable Health but lacks clarity on the coverage and available services.
   - Peta, as the business manager, expressed the need for better understanding of Vitable’s offerings and how they could be expanded to more employees.

2. **Current Healthcare Offerings and Needs**
   - Currently, around three employees from Successful Aging Care Net are enrolled in Vitable Health's services.
   - The organization also provides coverage through Keystone, which is primarily targeted towards administrative staff rather than field caregivers. 
   - Peta emphasized the need for healthcare solutions that are affordable and accessible for field caregivers, who are often left without proper health coverage.

3. **Overview of Vitable Health Plans**
   - Jeremy provided a detailed overview of Vitable's health plans, which include the Primary Care Plan, Well Care Plan, and Elite Care Plan.
   - **Primary Care Plan**: Covers primary care services including telehealth, lab services, mental health, and physical visits for employees and their families. This plan is provided at no additional cost to dependents.
   - **Well Care Plan**: Employee-paid plan that covers essential screenings and preventive care, including mammograms and colonoscopies.
   - **Elite Care Plan**: Employee-paid plan that includes specialist visits, imaging, and urgent care with some co-pays involved. It is more comprehensive but comes at a higher cost.

4. **ACA Compliance and Custom Plan Options**
   - Jeremy explained ACA requirements, including the importance of providing a Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) plan to all employees working 30 or more hours per week.
   - Peta was interested in exploring the possibility of offering a "carve-out"—retaining Keystone for administrative staff while providing Vitable’s plans to caregivers and other employees who require more affordable options.

5. **Integration with Payroll and Enrollment Ease**
   - A key requirement for Successful Aging Care Net is ease of access and integration with their existing payroll system (ADP).
   - Jeremy highlighted that Vitable offers an HRIS integration for $200 per month, which simplifies enrollment by linking directly with the payroll system for automatic addition and removal of employees.

6. **Financial Considerations and Affordability**
   - The conversation touched on the affordability of the Vitable plans, with Peta noting that the current Keystone plan is not financially feasible for many caregivers.
   - Jeremy proposed covering the Primary Care Plan for $50 per employee, while the more comprehensive Well Care and Elite Care plans could be offered as add-ons at the employees' expense.
   - He also mentioned the option to apply a small payroll deduction to make the primary care plan more affordable for the company.

7. **Next Steps**
   - Peta indicated interest in discussing the options internally with the company owner, Innocent, and getting back to Vitable for further discussions.
   - Jeremy agreed to send a brochure detailing all plans and options, along with additional benefits like TB tests to help incentivize enrollment.
