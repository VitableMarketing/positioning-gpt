2. **Employee Benefits Overview**
   - The main agenda was to revisit how Vitable Health could support Pampering Plus’s employee healthcare needs.

3. **TB Testing Challenges**
   - Jocelyn pointed out that the traditional **two-step PPD test** was cumbersome, especially when employees failed to complete the second step.
   - She preferred the **Quantiferon TB test**, which involves a one-time blood draw, making it less complicated for employees.

4. **Previous Challenges with Vitable Services**
   - Jocelyn discussed previous issues during the initial partnership with Vitable, such as miscommunications related to physicals and problems with pre-employment testing.
   - There were challenges particularly with urgent drug testing needs on Fridays, leading to logistical difficulties.
   - Brian acknowledged these issues and emphasized that Vitable had taken steps to streamline their processes to avoid similar problems in the future.

5. **Healthcare Plan Adoption and Participation**
   - Jocelyn mentioned that Pampering Plus employs over **100 employees**, but the participation in Vitable’s plans had been limited.
   - Initially, Vitable’s services were primarily used for **pre-employment screenings**, and adoption among employees for other healthcare benefits was low.
   - They discussed the need to better engage employees to make the healthcare offerings more attractive.

6. **Healthcare Integration and Improvements**
   - Brian outlined new improvements to Vitable’s offerings, particularly related to pre-negotiated rates for **Quantiferon TB tests** through **Quest** and **LabCorp**.
   - Integration of lab results and the ease of ordering tests were highlighted as significant upgrades. Jocelyn appreciated these changes, especially the automated system for issuing vouchers and obtaining immediate results.

7. **Cost and Employee Engagement**
   - Jocelyn noted that Pampering Plus currently provides **Keystone insurance** for employees, which is relatively expensive.
   - They explored the possibility of using Vitable as a complementary offering to the existing **Keystone plan** to provide coverage options for those employees who might not need or cannot afford the Keystone insurance.
