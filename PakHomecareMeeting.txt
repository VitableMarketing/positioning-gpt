### Summary of Meeting between PAK Homecare LLC and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Lauren Brady (Vitable Health)
- Hamid Sohab (PAK Homecare LLC)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Current Employee Benefits Situation at PAK Homecare:**
   - Hamid shared that PAK Homecare currently does not offer any formal health benefits for employees. They only provide bonuses and paid time off.
   - This meeting was PAK Homecare's first step in exploring available healthcare benefit options for their employees.
   - PAK Homecare employs 35 people, and Hamid is focused on potential growth in the near future.

2. **Employee Needs and Interest in Benefits:**
   - Hamid conducted an internal survey and found that while some employees expressed interest in health insurance, many were not interested even if it was offered. The lack of interest was due to the high costs and the perceived lack of value in coverage from previous employer-provided plans, especially concerning out-of-pocket costs and service exclusions.
   - Hamid emphasized that most of his workforce consists of young, healthy adults (average age between 20 and 30 years old) who generally do not feel an immediate need for health coverage but could benefit from it in case of accidents or unforeseen circumstances.
   - Employees complained about high co-pays, and services not being covered under previous health insurance plans, which deterred them from engaging with the offered benefits.

3. **Discussion of Vitable’s Offerings:**
   - Lauren introduced Vitable’s healthcare plans, which include the Primary Care Plan and the Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) plan.
   - The Primary Care Plan offers services like telehealth visits, which allow flexibility in scheduling appointments, and includes no monthly cost, co-pays, or deductibles for employees. This plan is particularly popular due to its ease of access and no out-of-pocket expenses for common healthcare needs.
   - The MEC plan offers preventive care services and helps meet the minimum ACA requirements, which would be relevant as PAK Homecare grows closer to the 50 full-time employee threshold.
   - Lauren explained that Vitable also partners with Aflac for supplemental benefits such as dental, vision, and accident coverage, which can be offered at no cost to the company while allowing employees to opt in if they desire.

4. **Employee Contribution and Company Costs:**
   - Hamid expressed that affordability is the top priority for PAK Homecare, especially given that many employees have other health coverage options like Medicaid.
   - The discussion explored the potential for PAK Homecare to offer healthcare options with minimal cost to employees while maintaining compliance with ACA requirements as they grow.
   - Lauren clarified that PAK Homecare could cover the Primary Care Plan at a fixed cost of $30 per employee, making it a predictable expense for the company. This would allow employees to access healthcare without any cost to them, increasing retention and appeal without significant overhead.
   - The company cost would be fixed at $1,050 per month (for 35 employees), regardless of fluctuations in employee numbers, as it is the minimum charge to maintain the plan.

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Hamid expressed interest in learning more about the specific coverages and exclusions under Vitable’s plans, particularly regarding hospitalization and ER visits, which are not covered under the Primary Care or MEC plans.
   - Lauren and Hamid agreed to schedule a follow-up call for deeper discussion and for Lauren to provide further details about plan coverage and other options that could be beneficial for PAK Homecare’s employees.
   - A follow-up meeting was scheduled for the same time next Wednesday to dive into the details and discuss logistics further.

1. **Company Name:** PAK Homecare LLC
2. **Company Industry:** Home Care Services
3. **Company Size:** 35 employees
4. **Previous Knowledge of the Affordable Care Act:** Basic understanding, looking to ensure compliance as they grow closer to the 50 full-time employee threshold.
5. **Core Challenges:**

   - High employee turnover in a fast-paced industry, which creates a need for a benefit that enhances retention.
6. **What They're Looking For:**
   - Affordable healthcare solutions that would be appealing to young, healthy employees who might not typically prioritize health insurance.
   - Transparent pricing that allows for predictable budgeting while maintaining some level of healthcare benefit offering.

- A follow-up meeting to be scheduled to discuss further logistics and determine the feasibility of offering Vitable’s plans at PAK Homecare.
