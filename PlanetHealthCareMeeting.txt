**Meeting Summary for Vitable Health and Planet Healthcare (October 4 & October 9)**

**Participants:**
- Shawn Parsons (Vitable Health)
- Brian Cottone Jr. (Vitable Health)
- Stellah (Planet Healthcare)
- Rachael White (Planet Healthcare)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Introduction and Background:**
   - Two meetings were held on **October 4** and **October 9** with Planet Healthcare to discuss Vitable Health's offerings and the suitability for Planet Healthcare's workforce.
   - Stellah, representing Planet Healthcare, highlighted their need for affordable health benefits that can help them attract and retain employees, especially in a competitive caregiving industry.

2. **Current Challenges for Planet Healthcare:**
   - **Staff Shortages**: Planet Healthcare is struggling to hire enough caregivers, largely because of the lack of medical benefits, which makes their positions less attractive compared to competitors.
   - **Growth Plans**: Stellah mentioned the need for more employees to keep up with increasing client demand, and how adding healthcare benefits is seen as a critical part of this expansion.
   - **Affordability**: Concerns around the cost of health plans, specifically for both employees and the employer, were frequently raised. The company currently has **70 employees** (50 full-time and 20 part-time) and would like to find a plan that does not impose a heavy financial burden.

3. **Overview of Vitable's Plan Offerings:**
   - **Primary Care Plan**: 
     - Provides primary care services at **$45 per employee per month**.
     - Employer contribution is required for full-time employees, which amounts to **$2,250 per month** for all 50 employees.
   - **MEC Plans (MEC Well Care and MEC Elite Care)**:
     - MEC Well Care and MEC Elite Care are designed for additional coverage but are voluntary for employees.
     - The MEC Elite Plan, offering a **Minimum Value Plan (MVP)**, was of particular interest to office staff.
   - **Minimum Value Plan (MVP)**:
     - This plan covers **emergency services** and was proposed as essential for ensuring compliance with **ACA regulations**.

4. **Key Concerns and Discussion:**
   - **Pricing Structure**: 
     - Stellah expressed confusion around the difference between the $30 and $45 Primary Care Plans. The higher cost ($45) is attributed to the inclusion of the Minimum Value Plan, which provides broader compliance and additional emergency services.
   - **Employee Enrollment and Contributions**:
     - Employees are not required to pay anything for the Primary Care Plan if they enroll. However, they would need to contribute if they opt for additional MEC plans or the MVP.
   - **Attraction and Retention**: 
     - Stellah and her team emphasized that having health benefits would be a significant incentive for employees, helping them attract new hires and retain current staff, who have been asking for medical benefits.

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Stellah will review the options internally, particularly the pricing structure and contributions for each plan.
   - Brian and Shawn will provide additional documents to clarify the **employer and employee costs**, specifically showing a breakdown of contributions for each health plan.
   - A follow-up meeting was suggested to finalize decisions once all internal discussions at Planet Healthcare have been completed.
