   - Procare employs **six full-time staff (W-2)** and has around **40 contractors (1099)**. They have not yet provided comprehensive health benefits and are assessing the feasibility of doing so now.
   - Nichola indicated that they are also in discussions with **ADP** to review health plan options for their employees and contractors.

3. **Core Considerations for Health Benefits**
   - **Cost** was identified as the most crucial factor for selecting a healthcare provider. Nichola emphasized that if the cost is too high, it limits the potential of moving forward, regardless of the plan's quality or brand.
   - **Emergency Services and Catastrophic Coverage**: Nichola stressed the importance of having coverage for **emergency room services and hospitalization**, noting that such benefits are vital to employees. She expressed concern that any plan without these options might be perceived as inadequate by staff.

4. **Overview of Vitable Health's Offerings**
   - **Vitable Primary Care Plan**: 
     - Ryan presented Vitable's **primary care plan** as a virtual, telehealth-based offering with no deductibles and no employee cost. This plan includes **episodic care, mental health services, prescriptions**, and **preventive care**.
     - The primary care services are employer-funded, available for **$30 per employee per month**.
   - **MEC and MEC Plus Plans**:
     - Vitable also provides a **MEC (Minimum Essential Coverage)** and **MEC Plus** plan for employees looking for additional coverage.
     - The MEC plan costs **$30 per month** for employees and includes wellness services, while the MEC Plus adds urgent care, specialist visits, and more for **$125 per month**.
   - **Hospitalization and Emergency Care**: Ryan clarified that the standard plans do not include emergency room or hospitalization services to maintain affordability. However, they also offer **critical illness and major medical plans** as optional add-ons that include emergency care, but these are significantly more expensive (**$445 per month**).

5. **Cost and Enrollment Requirements**
   - Ryan explained that there is a **minimum seat requirement of 35 employees** for Vitable's services. Procare currently employs **six full-time staff**, and extending benefits to all **46 workers (including contractors)** was discussed.
   - The base cost for Vitableâ€™s primary care plan would be **$1,050 per month** (35 employees at $30 each), regardless of the actual number of people who enroll, provided it meets the minimum seat requirement.

6. **Employee Concerns and Perceptions**
   - Nichola highlighted that without coverage for emergencies or hospital visits, employees might not view the plan as beneficial. She expressed that convincing staff of the value of a health plan that lacked these essential features would be difficult.
   - The perception of incomplete coverage could lead to hesitancy among employees to enroll, which is a significant concern for Procare.

7. **Next Steps and Follow-Up**
   - Nichola stated that she would continue conversations with **ADP** to see if they offer options that better meet their needs, specifically plans that include **emergency and hospital services**.
