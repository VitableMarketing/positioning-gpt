2. **Current Challenges with TB Testing**
   - Gretchen explained that Emerest currently uses **Quest Labs** for drug screenings but cannot utilize them for **TB tests** due to not having the capability to write the required script.
   - Currently, Emerest relies on local **MedExpress** or other urgent care facilities for TB testing, using the **two-step PPD process**. This setup has led to inefficiencies, such as employees forgetting to return for follow-up readings, resulting in delays and additional costs.
   - Ryan empathized with the difficulties described by Gretchen, acknowledging that the two-step TB test process is a widespread pain point in the home care industry.

3. **Vitable's TB Testing Solutions**

   - Gretchen was interested in Vitable’s capability of using Quest labs, which would simplify the process by providing a single location for both drug screening and TB testing.
   - Ryan also highlighted Vitable’s **automated reminders and scheduling system**, which helps ensure employees complete their tests on time by sending text reminders and directing them to the nearest lab.

4. **Lab Options and Cost Considerations**
   - Ryan provided details about Vitable’s partnership with **Quest** and **Labcorp**. He noted that **Labcorp** generally offers a slightly lower price ($15 cheaper per test) compared to Quest, depending on availability in the area.
   - Gretchen agreed to review Labcorp locations to determine if they might be a feasible option for her staff, especially for areas where Quest has limited accessibility.
   - Ryan explained the pricing structure for the Quantiferon Gold test, which ranges from **$70 to $80 per test** depending on volume. He suggested starting with a conservative number of tests and adjusting as needed to better manage costs.

5. **Platform Overview and Employee Engagement**
   - Ryan provided a brief overview of Vitable’s **digital platform**, including a dashboard that allows clients to manage employee onboarding, schedule tests, and track usage in real time.
   - Gretchen was pleased with the streamlined approach, noting its similarity to their current drug screening management system. She expressed interest in the **one-stop shop** model for employee health services.
   - Ryan also mentioned Vitable’s **customer success team**, which is available to assist clients with setup and ongoing support, ensuring smooth onboarding and compliance with healthcare requirements.

6. **Next Steps**
   - Gretchen expressed a need to bring in her internal team for a more in-depth look at Vitable’s platform, particularly to evaluate the dashboard functionalities.
   - Ryan agreed to send **Labcorp and Quest location links** so Gretchen could assess local availability. He also planned to follow up with detailed information on pricing and to confirm the data retention policies related to **HIPAA compliance**.
