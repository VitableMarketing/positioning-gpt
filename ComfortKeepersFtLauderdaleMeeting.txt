**Participants:**
- Ryan Plank (Vitable Health)
- Olivia Berens (Vitable Health)
- Susan Collins (Comfort Keepers Ft. Lauderdale)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Introduction and Current Healthcare Coverage**
   - Susan shared that Comfort Keepers Ft. Lauderdale has been exploring different healthcare options due to the high cost and limited coverage provided by their current insurer.
   - Their employees consist primarily of caregivers, many of whom are part-time and therefore do not qualify for full medical benefits under their existing plans.
   - Susan expressed interest in learning how Vitable’s offerings could provide a more affordable and accessible option for their workforce.

2. **Vitable Health’s Plan Offerings**
   - Ryan introduced the various healthcare plans offered by Vitable Health, emphasizing the affordability and flexibility they provide for home care workers.
   - The **Primary Care Plan** was highlighted as a popular choice at $30 per month per employee. It includes services like telehealth, in-home visits, prescription support, mental health services, and physicals—all at no additional cost for employees or their dependents.
   - The **MEC (Minimum Essential Coverage) and MEC Plus Plans** were also discussed, offering extended services such as specialist visits and urgent care, with prices ranging between $30 and $125 per month depending on the level of coverage.

3. **Employee Engagement and Benefits Utilization**
   - Susan raised concerns about employee engagement, noting that many of the caregivers were either unaware of available health benefits or found them too costly to enroll in.
   - Olivia highlighted Vitable’s engagement efforts, which include personalized onboarding sessions, benefit education materials, and proactive outreach to ensure employees understand their options and can easily access care when needed.
   - The group also discussed the potential for offering the **Primary Care Plan** to all employees, regardless of full-time or part-time status, to increase engagement and improve overall health outcomes among staff.

4. **ACA Compliance and Future Requirements**
   - Ryan provided an overview of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements for employers as Comfort Keepers grows towards the **50 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)** threshold.
   - He explained how Vitable’s MEC plans help businesses stay ACA-compliant by providing the minimum coverage required under federal regulations, thus avoiding penalties.
   - Susan appreciated the clarity on compliance and noted that Comfort Keepers would need to stay proactive in ensuring they meet future regulatory requirements.

5. **TB Testing and Onboarding Solutions**
   - Ryan introduced Vitable’s TB testing services, which offer one-step Quantiferon Gold testing via LabCorp and Quest. This process is designed to minimize onboarding delays, which are often caused by the need for new hires to complete multiple tests.
   - Susan mentioned that onboarding can sometimes take several weeks, largely due to the requirements for TB testing and other pre-employment checks. Ryan highlighted how Vitable’s streamlined process could help reduce these delays, thus improving time to productivity.

6. **Next Steps**
   - Susan expressed interest in potentially piloting Vitable’s **Primary Care Plan** for a segment of their workforce, specifically targeting those part-time caregivers who are currently uninsured.
   - Ryan agreed to send additional materials detailing the healthcare plan offerings, including a summary of benefits, network provider information, and TB testing protocols.
