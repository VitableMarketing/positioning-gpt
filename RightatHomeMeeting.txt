### Summary of Meeting between Right at Home and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Ryan Eiker (Host, Vitable Health)
- Nancy Udunka (Vitable Health)
- Pilar Suarez (Right at Home)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Purpose of the Meeting**
   - The meeting was initiated to explore whether Vitable Health could provide improved health benefit options for Right at Home employees compared to their current offerings.
   - Pilar Suarez, representing Right at Home, is interested in exploring new options and seeing if switching would be beneficial.

2. **Current Health Benefit Situation at Right at Home**
   - Right at Home currently offers health benefits, including a Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) plan, for both caregivers and office staff. This is their second year providing such coverage.
   - Prior to reaching 50 full-time employees, Right at Home utilized marketplace individual group policies for office staff.
   - The current plan costs $114 per employee, covered fully by the employer, with employees covering additional costs if they want to add dependents.
   - Pilar mentioned that the plan has been well-received by caregivers who previously had no access to such benefits. They appreciate the coverage, despite not having anything to compare it to.

3. **Vitable Health’s Proposal**
   - **Vitable Primary Care Plan**: Starts at $30 per employee per month. Covers telehealth services, in-home visits for physicals and lab work, mental health support, and allows for unlimited dependents at no additional cost. There are no out-of-pocket costs, co-pays, or deductibles.
   - **MEC and MEC Plus Plans**: The MEC plan provides preventative and wellness care, while MEC Plus also includes access to specialists, imaging, and urgent care. The MEC plan is an additional $30 per employee per month, while MEC Plus costs $125 per employee per month, totaling around $155 if combined with the Primary Care Plan.
   - Vitable offers an open network policy allowing employees to choose their own provider. Vitable also supports medical bill processing to assist employees in understanding their bills.

4. **Considerations for Switching**
   - Pilar highlighted the importance of quality and service for their employees, particularly for caregivers who are not accustomed to regular health checkups. Yearly checkups, lab tests, and wellness care are viewed as essential components of a high-quality plan.
   - Affordability, particularly from the employer's perspective, is also important. Pilar noted that any switch would require justification for an increase in cost from the current $114 per employee.
   - Ryan suggested that Vitable's offerings include family coverage, telehealth, and other services that Right at Home currently lacks, which could justify the higher price.

5. **Enrollment and Implementation Process**
   - Pilar asked about the logistics of switching from their current provider to Vitable Health. Ryan explained that Vitable’s customer support team would handle most of the setup and employee onboarding, including open enrollment sessions and tax filings.
   - Vitable offers a comprehensive support process, including waiver forms and maintaining compliance with ACA requirements.

6. **Next Steps**
   - Pilar will discuss the potential switch internally with her husband, who handles budgeting for the company, before making any decision.
   - They agreed to schedule a follow-up meeting to further compare the current plan with Vitable's offerings, allowing Pilar to assess whether the additional benefits justify the higher cost.
