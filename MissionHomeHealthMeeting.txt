**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Introduction and Background**
   - The purpose of the meeting was to determine if Vitable's health benefits could be a viable solution for Mission Home Health.
   - Kevin and Tripp were interested in understanding Vitable's offerings, especially given the recent rise in their current health plan costs with **Florida Blue**.
   - They mentioned their current setup with **Florida Blue**, offering two HMO plans and a PPO plan, and that employee participation had not significantly increased despite company growth.

2. **Challenges with Current Benefits**
   - **Cost Increase:** Mission Home Health has been facing significant cost increases for their current plans, including a **30% increase** in their recent renewal with Florida Blue.
   - **Low Enrollment:** Many employees were unable to afford the existing plan options, and current enrollment levels had not increased despite the company adding more employees over time.
   - **Limited Options for Employees:** Some employees were finding the current offerings unaffordable, leading to minimal uptake of coverage.

3. **Overview of Vitable's Offerings**
   - Ryan presented Vitable’s **Primary Care Plan** which provides a **no-cost option** to employees, covering **telehealth** services, same-day virtual appointments, and over **1,000 free prescriptions**.
   - **MEC Plan**: Covers preventive care, screenings, wellness visits, and is offered at **$30 per employee per month**.
   - **MEC Plus Plan**: Includes all MEC services plus urgent care, specialist visits, and other additional services, with employee contributions of **$125 per month**.
   - **Flexibility**: Ryan emphasized that Vitable’s offerings could be used as a standalone solution or as a supplemental option alongside the existing Florida Blue plans.

4. **Concerns about Network and Hospital Coverage**
   - Tripp and Kevin asked about whether Vitable’s plans included **hospitalization or emergency room services**, which the current options do not cover.
   - Ryan suggested a **Minimum Value Plan** (MVP) that could include hospitalization and emergency care and mentioned collaborating with a broker to potentially offer this as an additional option.
   - There was discussion about Vitable’s partnership with the **Health Smart Network**, which is a nationwide PPO network that has strong coverage in Florida, including key hospitals like **Ascension**.

5. **Cost Considerations and Implementation**
   - Ryan explained that the **cost for the primary care** portion would be **$30 per employee per month**, and Mission Home Health would need a minimum of **35 employees** enrolled to implement the plan.
   - Mission Home Health has **28 employees** currently interested, but they agreed that they would aim to meet the minimum enrollment requirement.
   - **Buy-up Options**: Employees would have the opportunity to opt for higher coverage (MEC or MEC Plus) at their own cost, providing flexibility based on individual needs.

6. **Employee Engagement and Next Steps**
   - Tripp expressed interest in gauging **employee interest** before making a final decision. He planned to bring the details to their next employee meeting on **October 8**.
