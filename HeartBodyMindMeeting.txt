   - Pearl expressed interest in understanding how Vitable could help given their current challenges with healthcare costs and coverage for their caregivers.

2. **Current Healthcare Coverage and Challenges**
   - Pearl mentioned they currently offer **Florida Blue** for their employees, but participation is very low due to the high costs. Only two employees are enrolled in the plan.
   - They have reached a point where they will be required to provide affordable healthcare options starting in January due to reaching the **50 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE)** threshold.

3. **Vitable’s Offerings and ACA Compliance**
   - Ryan explained that Vitable Health offers **Primary Care**, **MEC (Minimum Essential Coverage)**, and **MEC Plus** plans. These options are aimed at keeping companies **ACA-compliant** while offering affordable care to employees.
   - Pearl emphasized the need for different levels of healthcare plans to accommodate **senior management**, **office staff**, and **caregivers**, each with different needs and price points.
   - Ryan outlined how Vitable’s MEC and MEC Plus plans provide flexibility and affordability, including the use of telemedicine and partnerships with **LabCorp** and **Quest** for in-person services.

4. **Telemedicine and In-Person Services**
   - Pearl wanted clarification regarding whether Vitable’s services were entirely virtual or if in-person options were available.
   - Ryan explained that while primary care services are largely provided through **telemedicine**, Vitable does offer in-person services in certain states through partnerships, and they have plans to expand these in Florida.
   - For now, physicals, labs, and other necessary in-person services can be provided through partnerships with **Labcorp** and **Quest**.

5. **Employee Engagement and Wellness Clinics**
   - Pearl inquired about the availability of wellness services for onboarding employees, such as **physicals** and **TB tests**.
   - Ryan introduced the idea of **on-site wellness clinics**—in-person wellness sessions where Vitable brings in healthcare providers to conduct physicals and other necessary checks on-site. These clinics are available at no additional cost during the promotional launch period in Florida.
   - Pearl appreciated the convenience this would offer, as it could help streamline the onboarding process and ensure compliance without significant added cost.

6. **Affordability and Future Considerations**
   - Pearl and Sarah expressed concerns over whether pricing and free wellness clinic offerings would change after the initial year.
   - Ryan reassured them that Vitable is committed to keeping prices consistent through the first renewal period, especially since they are newly expanding in Florida and want to build a strong partnership.
