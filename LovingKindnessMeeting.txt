**Meeting Dates:**
- September 11, 2024 (Initial Discussion)
- September 23, 2024 (Follow-up and Deep Dive)

**Participants:**
- Lauren Brady (Vitable Health)
- Scott (Loving Kindness Healthcare Systems)

**Main Topics Discussed in September 11 Meeting:**

1. **Current Payroll and Benefits Structure at Loving Kindness:**
   - Scott shared that Loving Kindness is transitioning payroll services from in-house to QuickBooks Intuit Payroll Services.
   - The company is looking to move away from services like ADP and Paychex due to concerns about bundled services that limit flexibility.
   - Loving Kindness currently offers Aflac as a supplemental benefit but is exploring alternatives that better align with their financial needs and reduce tax liabilities.
   - Scott mentioned that a significant portion of their workforce consists of CNAs and home health aides who fall into the "working poor" category, many of whom are single mothers. Affordability is key when considering any new benefits plan.

2. **Vitable’s Potential Role:**
   - Lauren introduced Vitable’s healthcare options, highlighting how they cater to the specific needs of home healthcare workers, particularly for those who struggle with affordability.
   - The Vitable plan would focus on providing coverage for caregivers earning $10-$14 per hour, ensuring affordable access without high out-of-pocket costs.
   - The discussion also touched upon offering more flexible healthcare benefits that do not require employees to change providers, a major concern for Loving Kindness employees.

**Main Topics Discussed in September 23 Meeting (Follow-up):**

1. **Discussion on Census and Timelines:**
   - Scott acknowledged that he had not yet completed a census, which would be required for setting up open enrollment or evaluating the best plan fit.
   - Lauren explained that while a census is helpful for tailoring benefits, it is not immediately required unless Loving Kindness decides to proceed with Vitable’s benefits.
   - Scott confirmed his intention to have a new benefits package in place before the end of the year, indicating urgency in the process.

2. **Benefits Comparison and Aflac Update:**
   - Scott indicated that Loving Kindness might be moving away from Aflac due to tax-related benefits offered by an alternative provider.
   - Lauren provided an overview of Vitable's partnership with Aflac, describing how their plans work hand in hand with supplemental benefits such as dental, vision, and critical illness coverage.

3. **Healthcare Plan Overview:**
   - Lauren reviewed two key Vitable plans: one without hospitalization coverage and one with both ACA part A and part B compliance, which includes hospitalization.
   - Scott expressed affordability as the top priority, emphasizing the need for quality coverage without brand loyalty to large insurers.
   - Loving Kindness aims to provide employees with flexible options, avoiding forcing changes to existing healthcare providers. This aligns with Vitable’s open network policy, which allows employees to keep their current doctors.

4. **Employee Contribution and Company Costs:**
   - Lauren discussed the employee contribution options, including the Vitable Primary Care plan at no cost to employees, and other plans such as MEC and MEC Plus, which have modest monthly fees.
   - The company contribution was discussed, with a fixed minimum of $1,050 per month for 35 employees. This fixed cost allows for predictable budgeting without annual premium increases.
   - Scott appreciated the flexibility and transparency of the cost structure, particularly the absence of minimum enrollment requirements for MEC and MEC Plus plans.
