**Meeting Summary for Care and Life Lakeland and Vitable Health**

**Participants:**
- Ryan Plank (Vitable Health)
- Olivia Berens (Vitable Health)
- Mildrey Figuerola (Care and Life Lakeland)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Introduction and Current Challenges**
   - The meeting started with introductions and an overview of the purpose: exploring whether Vitable Health could provide TB testing and potentially other health benefits for Care and Life Lakeland.
   - Mildrey explained that Care and Life currently has a dispersed staffing model across multiple locations in Florida, with TB testing requirements posing challenges for their onboarding process. Employees are responsible for obtaining their own TB tests, which can often delay the hiring process.
   - The organization is looking for a solution that simplifies the process, reduces delays in onboarding, and helps employees find affordable testing locations.

2. **Current TB Testing Process and Issues**
   - Mildrey described the existing TB testing process, which involves new hires needing to obtain TB tests independently before starting work. This often results in delays of up to a month.
   - The current requirement is a two-step PPD process, which adds complexity and time to onboarding. The decentralized nature of their staffing adds to these logistical issues.
   - Ryan noted that this process creates a significant barrier to rapid employee onboarding, contributing to staffing shortages, and delays in starting billable hours.

3. **Vitable Health's TB Testing Solution**
   - Ryan presented Vitable’s TB testing solution, which replaces the two-step PPD process with a one-step blood test called Quantiferon Gold. This test reduces the number of visits required and significantly speeds up the onboarding process.
   - Vitable’s platform includes automated tools to manage TB testing logistics, such as referrals, reminders, and result tracking. These features can help to simplify the process for both HR and employees.
   - Ryan explained that results are delivered electronically and tracked through Vitable’s portal, ensuring that Care and Life retains ownership of the test documentation and can monitor progress efficiently.

4. **TB Testing Cost and Payment Options**
   - Mildrey mentioned that Care and Life currently does not cover the cost of TB testing for employees. Employees typically find their own testing providers, and costs can vary significantly.
   - Ryan outlined that the cost of Quantiferon Gold testing ranges from $120 per test, depending on volume, which can be more expensive compared to the two-step tests some employees find for around $20-$40.
   - Ryan suggested that the cost could be managed through payroll deductions if Care and Life were to fund the tests upfront, providing an incentive for faster onboarding and ensuring all compliance requirements are met.

5. **Discussion of Health Benefits**
   - Ryan briefly introduced Vitable’s health benefit plans, which start as low as $30 per month. These plans are designed specifically for home care workers and include incentives such as free TB testing for those enrolled in the health plan.
   - Mildrey expressed interest in learning more about these health benefits and how they could potentially be rolled out to Care and Life's staff, even though most of their employees are part-time and therefore do not currently receive health benefits.

6. **Next Steps**
   - Ryan and Mildrey agreed to schedule a follow-up meeting for the next week to discuss TB testing and health benefit plans in more detail. Ryan will also send over the pricing details and specifics regarding the health plans and testing options.
   - Ryan also proposed holding a spot on his calendar for a follow-up on October 4th at 10:30 a.m., with flexibility based on Mildrey's availability.
