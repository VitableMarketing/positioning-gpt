### Summary of Meeting between Home Care Advocate and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Lauren Brady (Vitable Health)
- Arun (Home Care Advocate)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Current Benefits Offering and TB Testing Practices:**
   - Home Care Advocate currently uses MedExpress for TB testing, including the two-step PPD test and chest X-rays if needed.
   - Arun shared that their organization has over 100 employees but performs TB testing only prior to hiring and occasionally as needed throughout employment. The average monthly number of TB tests is between four and ten.
   - Arun mentioned that they also perform some Quantiferon Gold TB tests, with the costs being $39 for each PPD step and approximately $117 for Quantiferon Gold.

2. **Interest in Vitable Health’s Offerings:**
   - Lauren presented Vitable’s healthcare options, highlighting the primary care plan at $45 per full-time employee per month, as well as additional plans like MEC (Minimum Essential Coverage) and MVP (Minimum Value Plan).
   - The primary care plan includes services such as telehealth, mental health support, free prescription drugs, and same-day provider access, while the MEC plans cover wellness and preventive services. The MVP plan provides a more comprehensive level of coverage, similar to standard health insurance.
   - Arun expressed interest in exploring Vitable’s TB testing solution due to its convenience and efficiency, as it includes a one-step gold blood test, automated lab vouchers, and a streamlined process using Labcorp and Quest locations.

3. **Cost and Benefit Challenges:**
   - Arun mentioned that the current UPMC plan covers eight employees, and the organization contributes 80% of the cost while employees cover 20% through payroll deductions. On average, the cost is about $350 per employee per month.
   - Cost was highlighted as the most important factor for Home Care Advocate, with Arun showing an interest in finding ways to save money while offering competitive healthcare benefits to employees.
   - The challenges with existing Medicaid users were discussed. Since many caregivers qualify for Medicaid, the additional benefits offered by Vitable could act as an incentive, especially because employees can add household dependents at no extra cost.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Arun requested additional details in an email to discuss the offerings with his team.
   - The parties agreed to set up another call for October 31st to discuss the benefits and TB testing program in more detail, after Arun’s audit is completed.
