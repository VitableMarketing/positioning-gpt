### Summary of Meeting between Adept Home Care and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Lauren Brady (Vitable Health)
- Eugene (Adept Home Care)
- Others present: unspecified participants (eusst and eshensky)

**Main Topics Discussed:**
1. **Current Benefits Offering:**
   - Adept Home Care offers a major medical plan with UPMC, covering 50% of the costs for employees. They provide three options (bronze, silver, and gold), and the company also covers 50% of the deductible.
   - The current employee uptake for the health plan is low—only three employees are enrolled.
   - Employees who are not enrolled often have other coverage options like ACA, Medicaid, or benefits through a spouse's job.

2. **Motivation for Offering Benefits:**
   - Eugene explained that offering health insurance was primarily motivated by the hope of attracting and retaining more caregivers, although there hasn’t been a noticeable impact on recruitment.

3. **Challenges with Existing Coverage:**
   - Due to the relatively high cost of the UPMC plan, employees with lower wages, especially those in caregiving roles, find it difficult to afford. Many prefer alternatives such as ACA coverage, which can be more affordable through government subsidies.

4. **Interest in Vitable Health’s Offerings:**
   - Eugene is interested in Vitable Health’s alternative plan due to its affordability compared to the major medical options.
   - Adept Home Care learned about Vitable Health through another home care agency that offered both a free option and a more comprehensive plan for a nominal fee of $30/month.

5. **Onboarding Process for Caregivers:**
   - They currently utilize MedExpress for health screenings such as TB tests. The onboarding process involves sending new hires to the nearest MedExpress or a smaller local provider for the required screenings.
   - Issues were discussed around the two-step PPD TB test, with many candidates failing to return for the second step, often resulting in using chest X-rays as an alternative.

### Company Information:

1. **Company Name:** Adept Home Care
2. **Company Industry:** Home Care
3. **Company Size:** 35 Employees
4. **Previous Knowledge of the Affordable Care Act:** Eugene and Adept Home Care are familiar with ACA, particularly in the context of caregivers finding better deals via ACA coverage and government subsidies.
5. **Core Challenges:**
   - Low uptake of offered healthcare plans among employees.
   - Difficulty affording competitive major medical plans for caregivers with limited income.
   - Challenges with the two-step TB testing process, resulting in delays in onboarding.
6. **What They're Looking For:**
   - A more affordable benefits plan to attract and retain caregivers, possibly through options like Vitable Health’s offerings that provide comprehensive yet more affordable healthcare solutions.
   - Improvements in the onboarding process, particularly TB testing alternatives that could reduce drop-off rates and associated onboarding delays.

### Next Steps Suggested:
- Lauren from Vitable Health proposed presenting detailed information on plan options that could supplement or replace the current UPMC offering.
- Further discussion about the TB testing program offered by Vitable Health, including pricing and potential convenience benefits through their partnerships with Quest and Labcorp.
