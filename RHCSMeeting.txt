**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Purpose of Meeting and Recap**
   - Lauren started the meeting by summarizing the points discussed during the previous meeting. The focus was on understanding the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirements and the health plan offerings.
   - Korsa emphasized the need for accessible healthcare services for employees, which was discussed previously, and how critical it is for their workforce.

2. **Overview of Vitable Healthâ€™s Plans**
   - Lauren provided an overview of Vitable's offerings, focusing on three health plans: the Primary Care Plan, the Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) plan, and the MEC Plus plan.
   - The **Primary Care Plan** has no out-of-pocket costs for employees and allows them to add unlimited dependents at no extra charge. This plan focuses on telehealth services for primary care, episodic care, and mental health support, with in-home visits for physicals and lab work if employees live in metropolitan areas.
   - The **MEC Plan** includes preventative and wellness care such as diabetes support, mammograms, and wellness screenings, with zero co-pays and deductibles. The **MEC Plus Plan** offers additional specialist care, imaging, and medical bill support, with co-pays ranging from $15 to $50.

3. **Affordable Care Act (ACA) Compliance**
   - Lauren explained the ACA employer mandate requirements for businesses with over 50 full-time equivalent employees. Korsa noted that although Reading Home does not yet meet the threshold, it is important to stay informed as the company grows.
   - Lauren also highlighted the potential fines for non-compliance, explaining the difference between Part A and Part B of the ACA mandate, commonly referred to as the "sledgehammer fine" for its impact.

4. **Supplemental Coverage with Aflac**
   - Lauren introduced **Aflac's Supplemental Benefits**, which include coverage for emergency services, critical illness, and accident coverage. The supplemental benefits do not cost the employer anything but could add value for employees who choose to enroll.
   - Korsa inquired if the Aflac plan would be a pre-tax benefit for employees, which Lauren confirmed.

5. **Cost and Enrollment Details**
   - The **Primary Care Plan** is offered at a flat rate of $30 per employee per month, with Reading Home needing to meet a minimum cost of $1,050 per month for up to 35 employees. If more employees enroll, the cost will increase accordingly.
   - The **MEC and MEC Plus Plans** are employee-paid, and contributions are pre-tax deductions from their paychecks. Enrollment for the MEC and MEC Plus plans is limited to open enrollment periods or qualifying life events.
   - Lauren mentioned that Vitable Health has an ongoing special offer, reducing the usual startup fee of $1,000 to $500 if they sign by the end of the month.

   - Korsa expressed interest in moving forward and getting the benefits rolled out as soon as possible, ideally by November 1. Lauren agreed to prepare and send the necessary agreement documents, including the discounted startup fee.
