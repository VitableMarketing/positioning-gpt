### Summary of Meeting between Pristine Home Care and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Lauren Brady (Vitable Health)
- Brian Cottone Jr. (Vitable Health)
- Farida (Assistant Director, Pristine Home Care)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Interest in Upgrading to a Higher Coverage Plan**
   - Farida confirmed Pristine Home Care’s interest in upgrading to Vitable's Part A and Part B compliant plan. This decision was prompted by employee feedback requesting hospitalization and ER coverage.
   - The current plan with Vitable includes a primary care option, MEC Basic, and MEC Plus, but employees have shown interest in expanding to cover higher-tier benefits.

2. **Overview of the New Plan**
   - Brian explained the new Minimum Value Plan (MVP) that would include emergency services and hospitalization coverage, aiming to provide more traditional health insurance elements such as urgent care, specialist visits, and emergency services.
   - The MVP plan would cost approximately $595 per employee per month, with a deductible of $6,500 and a $50 co-pay. Brian noted that it would likely have limited uptake among employees due to the cost.

3. **Alternative Cost-Effective Options**
   - As an alternative to the MVP, Brian suggested implementing an Accident and Illness Indemnity Coverage plan similar to an Aflac offering. This would be available as a voluntary benefit, covering events such as accidents, major illnesses, or hospitalization at a lower cost ranging from $10 to $40 per month per employee.
   - Employees would cover the entire cost of the indemnity plan, and it would not add any expense to Pristine Home Care. Farida appreciated this option as it could provide employees with additional support without increasing company costs.

4. **Employee Participation and Enrollment Concerns**
   - Pristine Home Care currently has about 275 employees, with 200 full-time workers. The discussion highlighted that while some employees might be interested in the higher coverage, it is likely only a few would be willing to pay the higher premium.
   - Farida was also interested in providing this voluntary benefit to part-time employees as a way to offer something extra without the need for Pristine Home Care to bear the costs.

5. **Enrollment Flexibility**
   - Brian clarified that Vitable’s plans, including primary care, offer rolling enrollment, which means employees can join throughout the year without needing to wait for the typical open enrollment period. This flexibility differs from the existing MEC and MEC Plus plans, which require open enrollment.
   - The accident and illness indemnity plan would work similarly, allowing employees to opt in at any time, which Farida noted would help address employees' requests for additional coverage when they needed it most.

6. **Next Steps**
   - Brian and Lauren agreed to send over the presentation on the new plans and options discussed, including detailed Aflac coverage levels and how premiums would be deducted.
   - The goal is for Farida to present these options to her management for a decision, emphasizing the affordability of the voluntary indemnity coverage as an appealing alternative.

**Company Information:**

1. **Company Name:** Pristine Home Care
2. **Company Industry:** Home Care Services
3. **Company Size:** Approximately 275 employees (200 full-time)
4. **Previous Knowledge of the Affordable Care Act:** Some understanding; the discussion touched on coverage types that help manage ACA compliance.
5. **Core Challenges:**
   - Limited employee interest in high-cost coverage plans.
   - Balancing the demand for more comprehensive healthcare benefits with affordability.
6. **What They're Looking For:**
   - More comprehensive coverage options, especially for hospitalization and ER services, without significantly increasing company costs.
   - Affordable voluntary benefit options that can be easily implemented for both full-time and part-time employees.

**Next Steps Suggested:**
- Vitable to send presentation materials and detailed information on the Aflac indemnity plan.
- Farida to review options internally and decide which coverage upgrades, if any, would be the best fit for Pristine Home Care.
