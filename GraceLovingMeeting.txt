### Summary of Meeting between Grace and Loving Home Healthcare and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Drew Hicken (Vitable Health)
- Brian Cottone Jr. (Vitable Health)
- Arthur (Grace and Loving Home Healthcare)

**Main Topics Discussed:**
1. **Current Benefits Situation:**
   - Grace and Loving Home Healthcare previously used Vitable Health for healthcare benefits but switched to a new provider due to pricing and coverage limitations.
   - Arthur mentioned they were introduced to a new benefits provider, Essential Benefits, which is a subsidiary of Aetna, providing coverage such as primary doctor visits, specialist visits, laboratory tests, and urgent care.
   - The current provider uses a default enrollment system which Arthur found problematic as it upset some caregivers by enrolling them automatically without explicit consent.

2. **Motivation for Re-Evaluating Vitable Health:**
   - Arthur was interested in understanding how Vitable Health’s current plans compare to his new provider, especially regarding the value they can offer in terms of pricing and flexibility.
   - There was also a discussion about the benefits of Vitable’s approach, including a more modern system for enrollment, which Arthur acknowledged was superior in keeping track of employee engagement and applications.

3. **Interest in Tuberculosis (TB) Testing Program:**
   - Arthur expressed interest in resuming TB testing through Vitable Health, as they found the Labcorp TB tests offered previously by Vitable beneficial.
   - Arthur had faced challenges dealing directly with labs like Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, including delays in communication and pricing issues. Drew highlighted that Vitable’s system could streamline these processes, providing a consistent source for TB tests.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Arthur agreed to sit down with his HR team to evaluate the volume of TB tests required and determine whether Vitable’s testing program could meet their needs.
   - Vitable Health will provide a proposal based on Arthur’s volume requirements and explore potential re-engagement in both TB testing and healthcare benefits offerings.
