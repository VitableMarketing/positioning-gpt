### Summary of Meeting between Home Instead and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Lauren Brady (Vitable Health)
- Brendan Kenny (Home Instead)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Current TB Testing Situation:**
   - Home Instead uses MedExpress and other local urgent care centers for their TB testing process.
   - The current TB testing procedure involves a two-step PPD test, with employees needing to visit the clinic multiple times, causing inconvenience and delays.
   - Brendan highlighted that this process is problematic and time-consuming for employees, especially with the requirement to get two shots, return for the reading, and wait for subsequent tests.
   - The cost for TB testing is currently about $70 to $75 for both steps, and Home Instead covers the cost.

2. **Interest in Vitable’s TB Testing Solution:**
   - Lauren presented Vitable’s streamlined approach to TB testing, which involves using the Quantiferon Gold test for convenience, providing faster and more reliable results.
   - Vitable's platform facilitates lab orders and enables tracking of employee testing progress. The testing process can be scheduled directly through Labcorp or Quest, ensuring that employees have multiple locations to choose from.
   - Brendan expressed interest in the convenience and efficiency of Vitable’s system, which could help reduce delays in onboarding and prevent employees from dropping out during the testing process.

3. **Costs and Financial Considerations:**
   - Lauren discussed Vitable’s pricing structure for TB testing, including the option to bundle tests quarterly, which offers flexibility based on the number of tests performed per month.
   - Pricing for Labcorp tests could potentially be lowered to match their current cost range of $70 to $75 if a commitment of around 25 tests per quarter is made.
   - Brendan indicated that Home Instead may not be able to make a decision immediately but is interested in moving forward after some internal review and planning.

4. **Benefits Offering Discussion:**
   - Home Instead currently offers Aflac benefits but has not yet implemented a MEC plan.
   - Brendan noted that they have about 70 employees, with 15 to 20 working full-time. They are approaching the ACA compliance threshold, which would require them to offer healthcare benefits to full-time employees.
   - Lauren provided information on Vitable's MEC plan, starting at $30 per eligible person, and suggested setting a follow-up meeting to go over the details of the benefits offerings.

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Lauren will send Brendan links to the locations of Labcorp and Quest facilities for TB testing.
   - A follow-up meeting was scheduled for October 10th to discuss the healthcare benefits in more detail and explore potential onboarding timelines.
