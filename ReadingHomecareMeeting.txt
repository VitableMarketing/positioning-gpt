### Summary of Meeting between Reading Home & Community Supportive Services, LLC and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Lauren Brady (Vitable Health)
- Korsa Kamara (Reading Home & Community Supportive Services, LLC)
- Omar and Mohammed (Reading Home Staff)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Current Healthcare Situation at Reading Home:**
   - Korsa Kamara explained that Reading Home does not currently offer any health benefits to their employees. They had previously looked into healthcare plans with another provider but decided not to move forward.
   - The decision was due to the high cost and lack of affordability, which led them to continue exploring more cost-effective options.
   - Korsa emphasized the importance of offering healthcare that is both affordable and comprehensive, with a focus on covering basic life-saving procedures.
   - The company employs approximately 38 to 40 people, of which around 20 are full-time.

2. **Vitable Health’s Proposal:**
   - Lauren introduced the available plans from Vitable Health, including the Primary Care Plan, MEC (Minimum Essential Coverage) plan, and the MEC Plus plan.
   - She emphasized the affordability of Vitable's offerings, with the Primary Care Plan being the most cost-effective option, costing the company only $30 per employee per month.
   - The Primary Care Plan also allows for unlimited household dependents to be covered at no extra cost, making it an attractive option for employees with family members at home.
   - Lauren also mentioned the benefits of the MEC and MEC Plus plans, which include more comprehensive coverage, such as preventative care, urgent care, specialist visits, and imaging services. However, none of the plans provide coverage for hospitalization or ER services.
   - To supplement this, Lauren suggested Aflac's critical illness, accident, dental, and vision coverage, which employees could opt for at their own cost without adding any expense to the employer.

3. **Prioritization of Coverage Needs:**
   - Korsa outlined the company’s priorities in terms of benefits: affordability was ranked first, followed by quality, and then the prestige of the healthcare brand.
   - Quality for Korsa means ensuring that basic health needs are met, including coverage for procedures like CAT scans and x-rays without high out-of-pocket expenses or co-pays.
   - He appreciated the flexibility of Vitable’s open network policy, which allows employees to visit any provider without restrictions.

4. **Enrollment and Costs Discussion:**
   - Lauren detailed the fixed pricing structure of $1,050 per month for up to 35 employees, noting that if Reading Home were to have fewer than 35 employees, the company would still need to cover that minimum cost.
   - She also clarified that Vitable Health does not have a minimum enrollment requirement for the MEC and MEC Plus plans, providing flexibility for the company in managing employee participation.
   - A startup fee of $1,000 was discussed, which would cover the setup of the portal, training, tax filings, and COBRA administration if employees leave the company but wish to retain benefits.

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Korsa expressed interest in learning more about the details of the plans, especially to evaluate how well the plans would meet the needs of the employees.
   - The team agreed to schedule a follow-up meeting for a deeper discussion into the specifics of the coverage, co-pays, deductibles, and network details.
   - The follow-up meeting was set for Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 PM. Lauren also agreed to send over the slides discussed during the meeting along with information on Aflac's supplemental coverage.

**Company Information:**

1. **Company Name:** Reading Home & Community Supportive Services, LLC
2. **Company Industry:** Home Care Services
3. **Company Size:** Approximately 38-40 employees (20 full-time)
4. **Previous Knowledge of the Affordable Care Act:** Limited; Lauren provided a brief overview of ACA requirements, emphasizing compliance options.
5. **Core Challenges:**

   - High costs associated with previous plan offerings led to limited action on implementing employee benefits.
6. **What They're Looking For:**
   - Affordable healthcare plans that offer basic coverage without high out-of-pocket costs.
   - Flexibility in adding dependents and options for voluntary supplemental benefits.

**Next Steps Suggested:**
