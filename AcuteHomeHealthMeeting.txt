**Meeting Summary for Acute Home Healthcare and Vitable Health**

**Participants:**
- Ryan Plank (Vitable Health)
- Brian Cottone Jr. (Vitable Health)
- Ian Rowe (Acute Home Healthcare)
- Ashley Reed (Acute Home Healthcare)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Healthcare Plan Cost Increases and Compliance Concerns**
   - Ian Rowe mentioned that the current health insurance carrier, Florida Blue, had raised their rates for 2025 by 60%, attributing the increase to a few claims that impacted the overall group rates.
   - Ryan acknowledged that this rate increase was significant and expressed Vitable's interest in exploring options that could provide a more affordable alternative for their staff.
   - ACA compliance was a major point of concern for Ian. He emphasized the need for a plan that met both parts A and B of ACA requirements while being affordable for employees, especially those who might not want to pay higher premiums.

2. **Vitable Health Plan Proposal**
   - Ryan presented Vitable's offerings, which included the **Primary Care Plan** as a fully employee-funded option, with telehealth services being the primary feature. This plan also included in-person benefits such as flu shots and lab services.
   - To address ACA compliance, Vitable proposed the **MEC and MEC Plus plans** to meet the minimum requirements under ACA part A, which could be combined with Vitable's other services.
   - Ian requested clarification on the ACA compliance aspects, especially on the requirements for offering minimum essential coverage and ensuring part B compliance, which includes hospitalizations and emergency care.

3. **Concerns About Major Medical and Self-Funded Options**
   - Ian expressed that the company was also shopping around for other plans through brokers, looking at fully insured options and exploring whether self-funded insurance plans might be viable for them.
   - Brian mentioned Vitable's capability of offering alternative insurance structures, including partially self-funded plans, which could potentially lower costs by paying for claims directly. However, Ian noted that the company's size might limit the feasibility of self-funding.
   - Ian reiterated that they were generally satisfied with their current broker but were exploring all avenues to reduce costs.

4. **Enrollment and Administrative Logistics**
   - Ryan outlined the enrollment process for Vitable’s plans, which included providing an employee census containing contact information such as phone numbers and emails. He reassured Ian and Ashley that Vitable would handle much of the administrative burden, including direct outreach to employees for enrollment.
   - The **$500 startup fee** was discussed, which covers the initial setup and implementation, including onboarding and employee training.
   - Ian indicated that any agreement would need to go through legal review before finalizing, and he was interested in seeing a detailed proposal, ideally by the end of the week.

5. **Next Steps**
   - Ryan agreed to send over the proposal for review, which would include the options discussed, such as the Primary Care and MEC plans.
   - Open enrollment was tentatively planned for December, with a goal for a January 1 start date. In preparation, a welcome call with Vitable’s customer success team would be scheduled, as well as a benefits training session.
