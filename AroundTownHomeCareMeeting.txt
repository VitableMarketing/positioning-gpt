**Meeting Summary for Around Town Homecare and Vitable Health**

**Participants:**
- Lauren Brady (Vitable Health)
- Brian Cottone Jr. (Vitable Health)
- Mary Johnson (Around Town Homecare)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Current Healthcare Coverage Challenges**
   - Mary shared that Around Town Homecare is currently struggling with the high cost of providing healthcare coverage through their existing provider.
   - They have a small group coverage plan, but it has become increasingly unaffordable for both the business and employees, especially with rising premiums.
   - Mary emphasized that their primary concern is finding a more affordable healthcare plan that still provides meaningful coverage, particularly for preventive care and urgent care services.

2. **Vitable Health’s Healthcare Offerings**
   - Lauren presented Vitable’s healthcare plans, focusing on the **Primary Care Plan** and **MEC (Minimum Essential Coverage) Plan**.
   - The **Primary Care Plan** is a low-cost option available at $30 per month per employee. It includes telehealth, mental health support, wellness visits, and physicals without out-of-pocket expenses.
   - The **MEC Plan** provides more extensive coverage, including wellness screenings, preventive care, and urgent care visits. Lauren explained that these services would provide a solid baseline of coverage for employees without significantly raising costs.
   - Mary was interested in how Vitable’s coverage could be extended to family members and dependents, which Lauren confirmed was possible at no additional cost for the Primary Care Plan.

3. **Concerns and Customization of Coverage**
   - Mary raised concerns about employee engagement, noting that previous plans were often underutilized because employees were not fully informed about the benefits or found them confusing.
   - Brian highlighted Vitable’s approach to employee onboarding, which includes personalized assistance and educational sessions to ensure that employees understand how to access their benefits.
   - There was also a discussion about including emergency care coverage. While Vitable’s standard plans do not cover emergency room visits, Brian mentioned that supplemental options, such as accident and critical illness coverage, could be added.

4. **Affordable Care Act (ACA) Compliance**
   - Lauren provided a brief overview of ACA requirements and how Vitable's plans could help Around Town Homecare meet those standards.
   - Since Around Town Homecare is approaching **50 full-time equivalent (FTE)** employees, ensuring compliance with ACA regulations is becoming increasingly important. Lauren explained that Vitable’s MEC plan would help them comply with ACA’s mandate for providing minimum essential coverage.

5. **Next Steps and Potential Partnership**
   - Mary expressed interest in moving forward with Vitable Health, particularly starting with the Primary Care Plan for all employees and potentially offering the MEC plan as an upgrade.
   - Lauren and Brian committed to sending a detailed proposal, including pricing options and a summary of all the benefits available under each plan.
