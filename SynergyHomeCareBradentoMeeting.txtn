**Participants:**
- Ryan Plank (Vitable Health)
- Olivia Berens (Vitable Health)
- Kenneth Gregson (Synergy HomeCare)
- Bernadette Gregson (Synergy HomeCare)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Meeting Objective**
   - The purpose of this meeting was to explore whether a partnership between Vitable Health and Synergy HomeCare of Bradenton could be beneficial in providing healthcare coverage for Synergy’s caregivers.
   - Ryan explained the goal of the meeting was to determine if it made sense to continue discussions and potentially form a partnership.

2. **Current State at Synergy HomeCare**
   - Synergy HomeCare of Bradenton currently has **53 caregivers** and **4 office staff**.
   - Most of the care staff do not have health insurance, and their primary option for medical care is visiting the **emergency room**, which is neither convenient nor cost-effective.
   - The office staff are more interested in obtaining insurance, but only **2 out of 4 office staff** have shown interest so far.
   - Bernadette mentioned they had previously explored options with another provider, but the plan offered wasn’t fully meeting their needs, specifically lacking in coverage for **doctor visits** and **prescription drugs**.

3. **Current Challenges with Health Coverage**
   - **Lack of Existing Health Plan**: There is no existing healthcare plan in place for caregivers, which forces many to rely on emergency services for routine medical needs.
   - **Affordability**: Bernadette expressed concern about finding a healthcare solution that is **affordable** for both the caregivers and Synergy HomeCare as a company.
   - **Coverage Needs**: Caregivers are looking for plans that include **office visits**, **prescription drugs**, and basic **hospital coverage** if needed, especially for themselves and their children. Many caregivers are younger, with relatively good health, so the focus is more on essential healthcare services.

4. **Vitable Health’s Offerings**
   - Ryan presented **Vitable Health's three-tiered plan**, which includes:
     - **Vitable Primary Care Plan**: A company-funded option that includes **virtual doctor visits**, **free prescriptions**, **mental health services**, and **lab tests**. This plan is designed to provide basic primary care access at **no cost to employees**.
     - **MEC Plan**: Includes wellness visits and preventive screenings, with an open network allowing employees to see any doctor and be reimbursed if they pay out-of-pocket.
     - **MEC Plus Plan**: This more comprehensive plan includes **urgent care**, **specialist visits**, and additional services such as **X-rays** and **imaging**.
   - The **Vitable Primary Care Plan** was highlighted as a good entry-level option, with the goal of shifting caregivers away from using emergency services as their primary form of healthcare.

5. **Affordability and Enrollment Considerations**
   - Ryan explained the cost for the **Vitable Primary Care Plan** would be **$30 per employee per month**, and the plan includes dependents at no additional cost. He noted that this plan could be offered to caregivers, even if they currently lack health coverage.
   - There is a **minimum enrollment requirement** of **35 employees** for the plan to be implemented. With 57 total employees, Bernadette was confident they could meet this threshold, but she also raised concerns about the fluid nature of staffing in the homecare industry.
   - Ryan clarified that if enrollment dropped below 35, Synergy would still be billed for 35 employees, with the additional costs being attributed to administrative "ghost seats."

6. **Next Steps and Follow-Up**
   - Bernadette expressed interest in proceeding with the plan, but requested some time to consider the details. She indicated that **October** would be a better timeframe to begin rolling out the new healthcare offering due to other ongoing initiatives at Synergy HomeCare.
   - A follow-up meeting was scheduled for **Tuesday, September 17th**, at **3:00 PM** to continue the discussion and potentially finalize next steps.
