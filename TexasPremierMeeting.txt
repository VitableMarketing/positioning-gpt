- Mathew Chandy (Texas Premier)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Recap of Previous Discussions and Current Coverage**
   - The meeting started with a recap of the previous conversation from October 3rd, where Vitable Health's plan offerings were introduced. 
   - Mathew currently has a Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) plan in place for around 75 to 80 full-time employees, costing $56 per employee per month. This plan has been in use since 2020, and Mathew fully covers it out of pocket.
   - Lauren acknowledged that Texas Premier is interested in more affordable coverage while maintaining a high quality of benefits for its employees.

2. **Employee Benefits Goals**
   - Mathew's primary goals for exploring new benefit options include reducing the financial burden on the business while ensuring that high-quality healthcare is available to his employees.
   - There is also a focus on offering plans that can assist in employee retention and help with onboarding new staff members in an industry with high turnover rates. 

3. **Vitable Health Plan Details**
   - Lauren presented details about three different plans: the **Primary Care Plan**, **MEC Plan**, and **MEC Plus Plan**.
     - **Primary Care Plan**: Includes no-cost primary care services, telehealth, mental health support, same-day appointments, and coverage for dependents. This plan is highly popular as it comes at no extra cost to the employees.
     - **MEC Plan**: Builds upon the Primary Care Plan by including all necessary preventive screenings such as mammograms, annual wellness visits, and cancer screenings.
     - **MEC Plus Plan**: Offers additional services such as specialist visits, imaging, and urgent care. However, it does not include hospitalization unless additional supplemental benefits are added.

4. **Supplemental Benefit Options**
   - During the meeting, Mathew raised questions regarding coverage for hospitalization and emergency care, as his current MEC plan does not provide these.
   - Lauren explained that Vitable can offer supplemental benefits, similar to Aflac, that include accident, critical illness, and life insurance options. This would allow the addition of emergency and hospitalization coverage without any cost to the business, as it would be paid by employees who choose to enroll in these additional options.

5. **Enrollment and Compliance**
   - The process for enrollment and waiver forms was discussed, including the procedure for new hires and employees leaving the company.
   - Lauren mentioned that Vitable can integrate with their census data to automatically add or remove employees as necessary. COBRA administration was also discussed as an option for departing employees.
   - Mathew asked about compliance with ACA mandates. Lauren clarified the requirements under parts A and B, ensuring that the plans offered through Vitable would meet the compliance standards and avoid fines.

6. **Next Steps**
   - Lauren and Mathew agreed to further review the specific needs for hospitalization and any additional services that would be required to make the transition beneficial for Texas Premier.
