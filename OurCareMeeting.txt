### Summary of Meeting between Our Care Inc. and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Ryan Eiker (Vitable Health)
- Sheku Bambino (Agency Administrator at Our Care Inc.)
- Tosin (HR Director at Our Care Inc.)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Current Health Insurance with Kaiser**
   - Sheku mentioned that Our Care Inc. is currently using Kaiser for their health insurance, but it is deemed too expensive, which results in a very low enrollment rate.
   - Currently, only 15 to 20 employees are enrolled with Kaiser, primarily due to affordability concerns. Employees feel the costs are high compared to their income.
   - Kaiser has communicated that the cost per employee would be lower if more employees were enrolled. However, the current pricing remains prohibitive.

2. **Vitable's Proposal**
   - Ryan presented Vitable’s offerings, including Vitable Primary Care, which costs $30 per month per employee, and a Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) plan costing $125 per month. The MEC plan includes specialist visits, urgent care, and more comprehensive coverage.
   - The Primary Care plan includes ten sick visits for the entire family, five mental health visits per person, three labs per year, and one physical per year, all with zero co-pays and no deductible.
   - The MEC plan can be paired with the Primary Care plan to provide more comprehensive benefits. Employees would have the option to contribute if they wish to upgrade to the MEC plan.
   - Vitable also has partnerships that provide optional dental, vision, and other supplemental benefits. These benefits would come at an additional cost to those employees who opt in.

3. **Employee Enrollment Strategy**
   - Sheku indicated that, given the current expense of Kaiser, the company was looking for more affordable health insurance options. Lower costs would likely lead to higher employee participation.
   - Ryan emphasized the flexibility of Vitable’s plans, particularly the option for the employer to decide how much to contribute, which can be helpful in managing costs while offering valuable healthcare options to employees.
   - Sheku proposed a 50/50 cost split between the employer and employees, particularly for those who want more comprehensive coverage with MEC, making healthcare costs more predictable and affordable for all involved.

4. **Concerns About Coverage Scope**
   - Sheku expressed concern about whether Vitable’s plans would allow employees to access healthcare facilities close to where they live, such as Lanham.
   - Ryan confirmed that Vitable’s Primary Care and MEC plans use a nationwide network. There is an open network feature that allows employees to use any doctor or specialist, and reimbursement is available for out-of-network visits. Ryan agreed to verify if the open network coverage includes urgent care and hospital facilities.
   - Specific questions arose regarding coverage for services like MRI and urgent care. Ryan clarified that while basic blood work is covered, MRIs are not covered under Vitable's primary care plan. These would need to be covered by additional health plans.

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Ryan will confirm the network availability for urgent care and hospitals and get back to Sheku and Tosin with this information.
   - Our Care Inc. to consider the 50/50 split proposal for the MEC plan to improve affordability and potentially replace Kaiser as the primary insurance provider.

   - Employees desire more affordable healthcare coverage that includes vision, dental, and urgent care.
6. **What They're Looking For:**
   - Affordable health insurance options that will increase employee participation and coverage without sacrificing quality.
   - Flexibility in contributing towards premiums to balance costs between the employer and employees.
   - Nationwide access to healthcare facilities for employees, including urgent care and specialist coverage.

**Next Steps Suggested:**
