**Meeting Summary for Vitable Health and Aloma Senior Care**

**Participants:**
- Ryan Eiker (Vitable Health)
- Eve Mancuyas (Aloma Senior Care)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Introduction and Overview**
   - Ryan began by following up on a previous conversation with Diane regarding Aloma Senior Care's healthcare needs.
   - The purpose of the meeting was to gather further information on Aloma's current benefits and to explore improvements through Vitable Health.
   - Eve highlighted the busy nature of her role and the challenges in effectively providing benefits to her caregiving team.

2. **Current Benefits and Challenges**
   - Eve stated that Aloma Senior Care currently uses **Ally Health** for employee benefits, which provides telehealth services at an affordable rate.
   - Key areas of improvement highlighted by Diane included adding **lab coverage**, **free prescriptions**, **coverage for adult dependents**, and access to **mental health services**.
   - Eve emphasized the challenge of **accessibility** for employees who are not tech-savvy, especially older caregivers. She mentioned issues with understanding the interface of the current virtual health program.
   - Eve also mentioned the difficulty in managing the **customer support** process, which often involved unnecessary back-and-forth communication between employees and the provider.

3. **Employee Categories and Accessibility**
   - Aloma Senior Care has two different types of benefits for **part-time** and **full-time** employees. 
   - Part-time employees, who make up the majority of their workforce, receive limited virtual health benefits due to the transient nature of caregiving positions. Eve shared that affordability and simplicity are key considerations when offering benefits to these employees.
   - Full-time employees, mainly the core administrative team, have access to a more comprehensive health insurance plan.
   - Eve stated that only **eight** employees were eligible for Ally Health benefits, and all eight were enrolled. She expressed concerns about the **high turnover rate** in the caregiving industry and its impact on eligibility for benefits.

4. **Vitable’s Proposed Solutions**
   - Ryan presented Vitable’s **primary care plan** at a cost of **$30 per month per employee**, which includes **zero co-pays, no deductibles**, and **free coverage for dependents**. Dependents are defined broadly, covering anyone residing in the employee’s household.
   - Vitable’s plan also provides over **1,000 free prescriptions**, **free lab services**, **annual physicals**, and **five mental health visits** per household member.
   - Eve expressed interest in the **zero co-pays** and **free prescriptions**, noting that these would be improvements over the current Ally Health plan, which only offers discounted prescriptions.
   - Ryan also discussed the **care navigation team** that assists employees in using their benefits, reducing the administrative burden on Aloma’s team. This feature was particularly appealing to Eve.

5. **Plan Flexibility and Future Considerations**
   - Ryan provided information on the optional **MEC (Minimum Essential Coverage)** and **MEC Plus** plans, which provide additional services such as urgent care visits and specialist consultations. These plans are ACA compliant, offering a pathway for Aloma if they grow to meet ACA requirements in the future.
   - Eve was interested in potentially offering these plans later but noted that current budget constraints and eligibility numbers made this less feasible at the moment.
   - The **minimum requirement** for Vitable’s primary care plan is **35 employees**, which Eve said would be difficult given their current roster. She stated that Aloma Senior Care is growing, and this could be reconsidered in the future.

6. **Next Steps**
   - Eve requested that Ryan send over the **package details** and **pricing information** for her to review.
   - Ryan suggested touching base again in **February** to see if Aloma Senior Care's eligibility had increased or if their needs had changed, particularly given their ongoing growth and accreditation processes.
   - They tentatively scheduled a follow-up meeting for **February 11** at **3:00 PM** to revisit the conversation and discuss potential implementation.
