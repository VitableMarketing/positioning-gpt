### Summary of Meeting between Lighthouse Hospice and Vitable Health

**Participants:**
- Ryan Eiker (Vitable Health)
- Trista (Lighthouse Hospice)

**Main Topics Discussed:**

1. **Current Health Benefits at Lighthouse Hospice:**
   - Trista mentioned that Lighthouse Hospice currently offers United Healthcare plans, including one HMO plan at no cost to employees and three PPO options available for employee, spouse, children, or family.
   - Additional benefits include high and low PPO dental plans, vision, and life insurance.
   - The company currently has around 68 employees, with 45 full-time, ACA-eligible employees. Participation in the healthcare plan is approximately 25 to 30 employees.
   - The cost for employees increases significantly when adding dependents to their plans, which is a major concern for employees.

2. **Vitable’s Primary Care Plan:**
   - Ryan introduced Vitable's primary care plan, which is designed to complement existing healthcare coverage.
   - Vitable’s plan provides primary care at no cost to employees, covering their entire household for $30 per month, with no co-pays or deductibles.
   - Benefits include telehealth visits, annual physicals, free prescriptions (if they fall within the list of 1000 medications), free lab work, and five mental health visits per person annually.
   - The service is provided through telehealth with the option for in-person annual physicals in certain service areas, including Chicago.

3. **Considerations for Adding Vitable’s Plan:**
   - The conversation highlighted how Vitable’s primary care plan could serve as an additional benefit for employees, particularly those not currently enrolled in the existing United Healthcare plan or those struggling with the cost of dependents.
   - Ryan positioned Vitable’s plan as a potential cost-saving tool for employees to reduce everyday healthcare costs, such as doctor's visits for minor illnesses and prescription costs.
   - Trista expressed interest in offering this plan to part-time and PRN staff, who currently have no benefits.

4. **Employee Preferences and Affordability Concerns:**
   - Trista emphasized that while Vitable's plan is appealing, many employees prefer major brand names they are familiar with, such as United Healthcare or Aetna, due to the perceived credibility and coverage.
   - Trista indicated that employees might view Vitable’s offering as an additional benefit rather than a replacement for major medical insurance.
   - Concerns were raised about employees' access to more specialized services like CAT scans, which are not covered by Vitable's plan.

5. **Next Steps:**
   - Trista will present the Vitable plan to Lighthouse Hospice's board of owners and aims to have their feedback by the end of the following week.
   - A follow-up meeting was tentatively scheduled for October 17th to discuss the board's decision and any further questions.
   - Ryan will provide Trista with additional materials, including slides covering pricing, benefits, and key details of Vitable's offering.
